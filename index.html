					<p>The unexpected beauty and the surprise that the landscape has in store for us at every step awaits us at the next station, Desi, hooked at an altitude of 1070m. with few inhabitants, in the winter months, mainly elderly people who greet you with the traditional glitz in hand and a lively smile on the lips, while in summer you hear children's laughter and intense conversations as Desi is flooded with locals and visitors.</p>
					<p>Desi is beautified with its characteristic architecture and construction by the stone-built houses, such as those of Diakos, Koutouza and Patrikeiko, which the locals say was built in 1620. The traditional ensemble is marked by the stone-built fountains as well as the traditional watermill.</p>
					<p>Many springs, torrents and waterfalls that cross the beautiful landscape and with their sparkling passage, break the absolute silence in winter and cool the environment in summer with a final destination near Acheloos. And somewhere up there, the nearby ridges of Eggo, Hameno, Xirovouni and Mesovouni, which in combination with the dense forests create an alpine landscape that has nothing to envy from its European counterparts. And of course in this nature next is to meet in your journey wild goats, deer, bears, wolves that are part of the wildlife that we meet throughout the area.</p>
					<p>The name of the village is mentioned in a document of Andronikos III Palaiologos, in 1336, while at the local meeting that took place in Zavlandia, Trikala (marked Paliopyrgos), the concession to Desi of properties owned by the Monastery of Megalon Pylon or Porta Panagia in this area was ratified It is also mentioned as the homeland of the priest fighter of 1821 Apostolos Hatzis.</p>
					<p>Desi is one of the authentic Vlach villages for this and the festivals that are a meeting place of the inhabitants, elements of joy and celebration could not be missing. On July 20, they celebrate the Prophet Elias, while on September 15, St. Bissariona, the party culminates after their stay in the village comes to an end. After the Liturgy and in the village square a feast is set up with dances and food with bulgur, the well-known "cauldrons".</p>

						<h3 class="text-center">Trout:The Queen Of Fresh Water</h3>
						<p>The pride of the Greek mountain rivers is the trout! It is a beautiful fish that belongs to the "salmonidae" family. In the following text we will refer to the trout from the point of view of biology, its behavior and its special habits.</p>
						<h3 class="text-center">The biology Of The Trout</h3>
						<p>Trout is a fish that loves cold, clear and quite oxygenated waters. The appropriate temperature where it notes its greatest activity is 12-15 degrees Celsius. When the water is very cold and below 4 degrees it stops growing. Like in the summer when the temperatures rise and the water exceeds 20 degrees,you cut her appetite for food. Of course this is a basic rule but not fixed since I have caught fish with a water temperature of 26 degrees!!!! I find that habits are different from river to river. Trout are highly adaptable based on the characteristics of the rivers they live in. Trout have a slender body covered with small scales and a large mouth armed with small teeth even on their tongue! The color of this fish is very difficult to characterize. Their diet, the biology of the river and the depth of the waters make the trout adapt to any situation and change its color, creating a camouflage to perfectly match the environment in which they live. The size of the trout can exceed one meter and reach up to 10 kg !!! Of course, this presupposes a suitable environment for her to develop so much and great luck so that the person does not find her in a much smaller size and take her life… Trout is a carnivorous fish. At a young age it feeds exclusively on water insect nymphs and insects that it takes from its surface. When it starts and grows, it adds to its diet various shellfish, frogs and small fish of its kind, but insects remain as a basic diet! The diet of the fish plays a big role for the fisherman and is one of the necessary knowledge that he must possess.</p>
						<h3 class="text-center">The Reproduction Of The Trout</h3>
						<p>The trout is a retro fish that swims upside down in the river and is led to the burrows where it was born to lay its eggs. This migration usually begins in the fall where you breed in the winter. Here I would like to emphasize that in our country there is a law that prohibits fishing during its reproduction from November 1 to February 15. During this migration, the trout makes enormous efforts to reach its destination by climbing small waterfalls and jumping small dams! There the female finds a shallow stream where she digs a small hole in the gravel and lays her eggs. The laying of eggs and their fertilization by the male is done in the evening. The female is said to lay about 2000 eggs for every pound of her body weight. If the river water has a constant flow and level, it is estimated that the eggs hatch within 40-50 days after laying. After its reproduction again, when the temperature starts to rise and the water warms up, it takes the road to the lowest in the rivers or lakes, looking for deeper and cooler waters.</p>
						<h3 class="text-center">The Trout Loot</h3>
						<p>As we said the trout lives in clear, cold and quite oxygenated waters. Ideal places where we meet this fish are the mountainous running streams, rivers and lakes with the same quality water. After the breeding season, the trout become localized fish and set up their carter in places with calm waters that swirl and bring their food. Ideal points for their crankcase are the large ponds and especially at the beginning of the pond and large stones that sit behind them and destroy any living organism that passes by them and above them. The trout is a very aggressive fish in terms of its area. It violently defends its position from any invader that may even be another fish of its species…. Larger fish usually hold the best position as the water current brings them the most food and do not allow other smaller ones to approach them. So when fishing for a good spot and you do not see any small fish be very careful because there may be something remarkable underneath!</p>

						<p class="card-text">In Greece there are two species of trout called fario and rainbow. Fario has been living in the rivers of our country for thousands of years. Its color usually has red and black dots, although this is not necessary and changes from river to river.</p>

						<p class="card-text">The rainbow is imported and comes from America. He came to Greece purely for breeding and nutrition. The biggest reason you introduced this species is because its growth rate is much higher than the domestic one. Several of them quickly managed to adapt to the environment of our rivers together with fario. The American trout is much more greedy and less selective than ours and that makes its fishing easier. Separating from home is easy. Its color has a reddish phosphorescent line along both sides and has no red spots unlike most fario.</p>

						<h4 class="text-center">Fishing techniques</h4>
						<p class="card-text">Trout fishing, believe me, is not an easy task and requires a lot of knowledge on the habits of the fish. There are several ways to fish it. The most exciting and popular fishing technique around the world is fly fishing. A variation of fly fishing that is used by many fishermen in our country is buldo fishing and a set of 3-4 artificial flies. Another technique is spinning where we use various artificial baits such as butterflies, silicones and teaspoons. And finally the classic fishing with live bait such as worms, locusts, small live fish etc etc .. These are the most basic trout fishing techniques found in Greece.</p>
